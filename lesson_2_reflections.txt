(R) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a bookkeeping directory called ".git" and tells you that any files
in the repository are untracked.

If you want to add them, then you need to use git add and later commit to keep
the changes tracked.

The .git directory is quite full with other directories and things for git to work.



(R) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
(R) What value do you think it offers?

So these were added to the file after I added it to the staging area.
If I make changes to this file - like I am now - will they be taken into the staging area as
well?

Staging area vs working directory and repository? Depends on the behavior If I add files to the
staging area are they copied there and now separate from the files in the working directory?
Or it may be that they are just a list of files to be grouped together into the commit.
