(R) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a bookkeeping directory called ".git" and tells you that any files
in the repository are untracked.

If you want to add them, then you need to use git add and later commit to keep
the changes tracked.

The .git directory is quite full with other directories and things for git to work.
