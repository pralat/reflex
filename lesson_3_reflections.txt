(R) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You could use your computer at work, or your computer at home, or you laptop and each one 
could have a local repository. That way, no matter where you are you can still work. Provided though
the work has been commited so that they (the 3 computers) all agree on the state of the files.

(R) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There would be trouble/conflict/confusion if it was done automatically. Changes that could lead to conflicts may come and go as multiple people change things that you may be working on. Build may fail. To have things
change in the middle of you creating a new feature or fixing a bug would give rise to too many problems.


(R) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks - are copies of a repository on github. It is "connected" to the original branch, such that the
original owner can see who forked (copied) their repository. It is easy then for you to submit code back to
the original repository.

clones - are copies of repositories on the local machine. The origin could be local or remote.

branches - are in the repository and are used to track similar changes. For instance you could create
a branch in which to a new feature, or a branch for bug fixing. The branches keep changes logically
grouped.
